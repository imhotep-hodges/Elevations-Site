# Elevations Beauty Bar-WebSite
Website Project for FAU Quickstart Course

Pages: 3 (Home | Appointments | Gallery)

Description: Business website for a hair salon. It promotes Banding, Contact Info, and allows clients to request Appointments. 

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap 4

Ideas for future improvement: 

- Spacing Issues for Mobile Browsers. May be resolved by trying a different framework or different elements. 

- CSS issues. Page looks different on different browsers. 

- I will remove the Tab Gallery and try a different Gallery layout in order to improve the display for mobile browsers
